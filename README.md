## Why use YAVP?

YAVP is not meant to compete with players like VLC or MX Player.
I do not maintain it for the sake of being better than other apps. It is meant as a simple Video Player you can use to Stream Videos over the Internet.
That said, here are some reasons to pick YAVP over other apps:

* **Free with no Ads**
	* *looking at you, MX Player*
* **YAVP is built using the most recent SDK build tools** for best compatibility with both phones and tablets
* **It requires no app permissions**, so it can't spy on you
	* Storage Permissions are needed to play back local Videos, but granting those permissions is not needed if you just want to stream
* **YAVP is a native Android App written in Java using Android Studio**
	* so no Xamarin/Visual StudioðŸŽ‰
